# Evaluation Metrics

Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning models are built on a constructive feedback loop: you develop a model, evaluate it using metrics, improve it, and repeat the process until you achieve satisfactory performance. Evaluation metrics are essential, they provide the feedback needed to refine and select models that perform well in real-world scenarios.

In this article, we will cover the most important evaluation metrics that every data science professional must understand and apply. These metrics allow you to objectively compare models and ensure robustness before deploying them into production.

## What Are Evaluation Metrics?

Evaluation metrics are **quantitative measures** used to assess the performance and effectiveness of a machine learning model. They offer insights into:

- Predictive power
- Generalization capability
- Model robustness and reliability

Choosing the right evaluation metric depends on the problem type (classification, regression, ranking, etc.), dataset characteristics, and business objectives.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Building a predictive model is *not* the end goal. The aim is to develop a model that performs **well on out-of-sample (unseen) data**. Skipping model evaluation can result in misleading predictions and flawed decision-making.

## Why Metrics Matter

Many beginner analysts or data scientists rush to apply models on test sets without understanding their robustness. A good model is not just about achieving high performance on training data—it must generalize well to new data.

To do this, we must **evaluate models using proper metrics** before trusting their predictions.

Different models require different evaluation strategies, and choosing the wrong metric may hide performance issues or overstate model success. Metrics are also vital during:

- Model comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Business decision-making
