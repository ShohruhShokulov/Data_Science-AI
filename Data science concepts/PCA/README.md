### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. It transforms the data into a new coordinate system where the greatest variance lies on the first coordinate (principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.
### Key Concepts
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while retaining the essential information.
- **Variance**: A measure of how much the data varies; PCA seeks to maximize variance in the new feature space.
- **Principal Components**: New features created by PCA that are linear combinations of the original features.
### Applications
- **Data Visualization**: Reducing high-dimensional data to 2D or 3D for visualization.
- **Noise Reduction**: Removing less significant features that may introduce noise.
- **Feature Extraction**: Creating new features that capture the most important information in the data.
